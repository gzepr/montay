```
Once I met an old man planting a tree 
In it's garden, and i wondered why
He said he'd always liked to live his life as if 
He would never die eventually
That was a surprise, i thought: "How interesting 
I use to do the other way around
I always live as if I'll die tomorrow!"

You wish you had time 
To do more things
You wish you had time 
To do nothing
You wish you had time 
To do more things
You wish you had time 
To do nothing

You wish you had time 
To do more things
You wish you had time 
To do nothing
You wish you had time 
To do more things
You wish you had time 
To do nothing

Should I jump in?
Add my own melody?
Or should I just sit 
And enjoy the music?
Is it best to be a bird fighting gravity?
Or a snake feeling earth all along its body?

You wish you had time 
To do more things
You wish you had time 
To do nothing
You wish you had time 
To do more things
You wish you had time 
To do nothing
